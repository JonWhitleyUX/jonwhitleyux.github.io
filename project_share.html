        <p>
            I wanted to try my hand at designing an app that would handle
            buying and selling stocks, and at the same time I didn't just
            want it to be another investing app. So the point of this app
            was never to be an "investing app", but rather to be something
            akin to a PayPal or a Venmo, but instead of directly handling
            money, you would instead be directly trading stocks.
            <br><br>
            So I started, as I like to do, by writing down a list of the 
            desired and necessary functionalities, and once those were 
            assembled I started to get an idea of what the app would like, 
            so I dove straight into a sketch. I did a rough sketch of the
            wireframe; you can see both my list of features and my sketches
            below.
        </p>
        <div class="planningImages">
            <a href="images/project_share/Share_Sketch_1.jpg"><img src="images/project_share/Share_Sketch_1.jpg" class="loFiImage" alt="Planning Image"></a>
            <a href="images/project_share/Share_Sketch_2.jpg"><img src="images/project_share/Share_Sketch_2.jpg" class="loFiImage" alt="Planning Image"></a>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once this stage was complete I proceeded on to the stage of 
            doing a simplified low-grade computer wire-frame. I changed
            some elements of the design from left to right so that 
            the elements may be more easily reached by right-handed users.
            You can see those renders below:
        </p>

        <p>
            The structure of this app from the low-fidelity prototype to 
            the high-fidelity prototype largely stayed the same. Here are
            the final renders. This was a great project for me; it gave me
            a chance to explore some different styles of interaction, such
            as rotating information carousels instead of scrolling pages.
            I like how it turned out. Here are the final renders:
